    <div class="bio">
         Born in Ohio in ye olde 1992, (an age that only 90’s kids truly remember), D.J. Stewart’s passion for humor and zany storytelling began in front of a television at four years old. Inspired by the Saturday morning cartoons on Fox Kids, Stewart began creating flip books and thaumatropes at age four, fascinated by the illusion of movement they created. </p>
    <p>
        Stewart began creating short comic strips while bored in class in second grade, eventually writing a full length comic called Karate Cat by age twelve, the completion of which instantly sparked passion for a new medium of storytelling. Stewart began indiscriminately garnering a collection of art books (good and bad) and attending comic classes at a local library, determined to learn more about storytelling. Stewart amassed an extensive library of 1,200+ pages of comics drawn by high school, (many of which you’ll find on this site, lucky you!) and ventured into self taught animation before finally attending an animation camp at 826Michigan at age 17. During the camp, Stewart was an animator on a short collaborative film entitled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.826michigan.org/feature-of-the-month-roboto/">“Roboto” </a> which showed in the Hiroshima Film Festival in Japan and the Annecy Film Festival in France before winning “Best of Show” in the 43rd Annual Michigan Student Film and Video Festival. </p>
    <p>
        Stewart received a BFA in Character and Experimental Animation from the College for Creative Studies in 2015, where Stewart also worked as a teacher assistant. Stewart has instructed animation, filmmaking, and comic development classes at the Ann Arbor Art Center, Los Angeles Public Library, and Hands4Hope LA. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        A few of Stewart’s notable accomplishments include working as a clean up animator on Season 1, Episode 4 of the show <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5905038/">HarmonQuest.</a> and as Chief Animator on <a target="_blank" href=" https://honeysucklemag.com/historic-new-years-eve-campaign-puts-honeysuckle-and-cannabis-brands-on-high/ ">Honeysuckle Magazine’s New Year’s Eve Billboard Campaign</a> in Times Square. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Stewart’s non artistic notable achievements include; passing the ACT at age 12, making the top 12% out of 8000 participants in the Michigan Mathmatics Prize Competition, and getting 4th place in an annual pi-day contest by memorizing 121 digits.   
    </p>

    <p>
        When not drawing, Stewart can be found taking the occasional comedy class, building things at the local makerspace, listening to metal or playing the otamatone.
